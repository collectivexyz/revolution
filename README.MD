# collective revolution

[NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf/) emerged as the first grass-roots way to bootstrap a digital-first community with money to get shit done.  

Nouns has been incredibly successful at both accumulating capital ($100mil to date) and curating a group of impressive members. However, the barriers to gaining ownership stake in the community leave much to be desired. The revolution protocol adopts and iterates on some key lessons from the nascent Internet society created through the Nouns protocol. 

The goal of the revolution protocol is collectively curated ownership distribution that results in an aligned on-chain social graph bootstrapped with capital (both IP and monetary) that is broadly accessible.

How do we enable permissionless collective curation of both energy and people?

The revolution protocol consists of three continuously operating paradigms. 
1. A submission period
2. A voting period
3. An auction period

On January 1st, 2023, the first collective will launch. For 7 days, a submission box will be open for anyone to submit proposals. Think of these proposals as your membership application. The top proposals will come from the people best suited to join the collective, and will come paired with a piece of art (think painting, software, song, video etc.) offered up as tribute. Others can be promises to build products, finished infrastructure, etc. 

After the first membership submission period ends 7 days later, another submission period begins. At the same time, for the next 7 days, the founding group who controls initial governance will collectively decide on the top submissions during a voting period. At the conclusion of the second week, the top submissions will move to a 7 day auction period, and the newly submitted proposals will move to the voting period. 

During the auction period, each day, for the 15th until the 21st day, one submission of the top submissions and it's associated art piece will be publicly auctioned off to the highest bidder. The winning bidder will receive one share in collective governance represented as a unique piece of culture, their community identity, as well as the art piece submitted. On the other hand, the submission author can choose a continuous split of 50% of the auction proceeds or a single governance share. The remaining proceeds will go entirely to the collective. 

After the initial cold-start, the voting, submission, and auction periods will perpetually operate in tandem, feeding into each other. 

The first problem solved is how to incentivize people to join a collective. Assuming someone makes a proposal submission to join that moves to auction, they are directly paid a split of the auction proceeds. 

The next problem is how to make sure ownership stake in the collective is broadly accessible but reflects the will of the community. The community can vote on who has the right to join and take submissions from anyone. Also, anyone can bid on auctions. Furthermore, people can pool their efforts and co-create membership proposals. 

The final issue is how to ensure that collective membership isn't decided by whoever can deploy the most capital to win the auction. Winning bids get 1 governance token, and the membership proposal author(s) gets another. The protocol also enables groups of people to party-bid auctions. 


Thanks to Danny, John, Danny, Jamal, Chris and the many others who helped formulate this revolution,

Let's free culture from the grips of corporations and enable collectives to live long and prosper, finally empowered to affect positive change in the realm of real materials.
