# collective revolution

[NounsDAO](https://nouns.wtf/) emerged as the first grass-roots way to bootstrap a digital-first community with money to get shit done.  Nouns has been incredibly successful at both accumulating capital ($100mil to date) and curating solid members. However, there exist large capital barriers to gaining ownership stake in the community. 

The revolution protocol adopts and iterates on some key lessons from the nascent Internet society created through the Nouns protocol. 

The goal of revolution is collectively curated ownership distribution that results in an aligned on-chain social graph bootstrapped with capital (both IP and monetary) that is broadly accessible.

How do we enable permissionless collective curation of both energy and people that is accessible to all?

The revolution protocol consists of three continuously operating paradigms. 
1. A submission period
2. A voting period
3. An auction period

On January 1st, 2023, the first collective will launch. For 7 days, a submission box will open for anyone to submit proposals. Think of these proposals as membership applications, at least in the beginning. Proposals will come paired with a piece of culture (think painting, software, song, video, infrastructure, products etc.) signifying unique energy that desires a hand in the revolution.

After the submission period ends 7 days later, another submission period begins. At the same time, for the next 7 days, the founding group who controls initial governance will collectively decide on the top submissions during a voting period. At the conclusion of the voting period, the top submissions will move to a 7 day auction period, and the recently submitted proposals will move to a new voting period. 

During the auction period, each day, one submission from the top submissions and it's associated cultural piece will be publicly auctioned off to the highest bidder. The winning bidder will receive one share in collective governance, in the form of a community identity, as well as the cultural piece submitted. 50% of the auction proceeds will go towards the revolution. The purchased submission author can choose a direct ratio between the remaining 50% of auction proceeds and a single governance share. 

After the initial cold-start, the voting, submission, and auction periods will perpetually operate in tandem, feeding into each other. 

The first problem solved is how to incentivize people to join a collective. Assuming someone makes a proposal submission that moves to auction, they can be directly paid a split of the auction proceeds. 

The next problem is how to make sure ownership stake in the revolution is broadly accessible but reflects the will of the community. The community can vote on who has the right to join, but can take submissions from anyone. Also, anyone can bid on auctions. Furthermore, people can pool their efforts and co-create both membership proposals and auction bids.

The final issue is how to ensure that collective membership isn't decided by whoever can deploy the most capital to win the auction. The winning bidder receives 1 governance token, and the membership proposal author(s) can choose to receive another. This dynamic balances the ownership-curation scale between capital and reputation + outcomes. 

Thanks to Danny, John, Danny, Alan, Wesley, Jamal, Chris, Arman and the many others who helped formulate this revolution.

Let's free culture from the grips of corporations and enable collectives to live long and prosper, empowered to affect positive change in the realm of real materials.
